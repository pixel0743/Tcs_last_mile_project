Problem Statement

Farmers often face challenges in connecting directly with buyers, leading to dependency on 
middlemen and reduced profits. The agricultural supply chain lacks transparency, causing issues 
like unfair pricing, delayed payments, and difficulty in tracking crop demand. Additionally, 
buyers struggle to verify product quality and ensure timely delivery.
• Farmers lack direct access to reliable markets. 
• Buyers face challenges in sourcing quality produce. 
• Absence of a centralized platform for farmers, buyers, and logistics.
• Lack of real-time data on crop availability, demand, and prices.
